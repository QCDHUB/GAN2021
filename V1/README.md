# Center-of-mass frame LS-GAN

The main notebook is gen\_events.ipynb, which is set up for the CM-frame GAN (it was trained on CM-frame 4-vectors). It calls the external Python codes mceg.py and tools.py. Furthermore, it uses the generator files gamma\_hist.npy, generatorfilter00466.h5, gfeaturesmean.npy and gfeaturesstd.npy.

All these files should be uploaded to jupyterhub, and will then run on "ai-notebook" self-consistently.
