# Code in development

The folder "Yasir" has a notebook on the GAN generator of events.

In the folder "Astrid", codes for generating and comparing Ylm for data from CLAS and GAN are at their current development stage.

The folder "Pawel" contains GANs in development: one trained on center-of-mass 4-momenta and one on a combination of invariants and other variables (complete and minimal set).
