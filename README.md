# GAN2021

This is a repo for the GAN codes in development (Dev) and in their current final versions V0 and V1. V0 is the working lab-frame Wasserstein GAN generator. V1 is the working CM-frame LS GAN generator. V1 is newer and generates data that is more compatible with real CLAS data. See the README texts in the corresponding folders for further explanations.
